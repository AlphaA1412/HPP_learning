## Code Project For Course ECE408
This is code project for ECE408(Applied Parallel Programming). And you can use this project as a good start for your own lab implementation. Here's how you finish your own project.

### 1. Finish your own code based on template code
`mpx_template.cu` are template codes and you need to full fill these code files. For me, I add these implementations in `mpx_implement.cu`.

### 2. Compile & Run
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
